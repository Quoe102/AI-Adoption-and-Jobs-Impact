# AI-Adoption-and-Jobs-Impact
Exploring the relationships between AI adoption by companies, AI software revenues and job joss and job creation

## Overview
This project analyzes the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) over time and its impact on jobs. Using Python for predictive analysis and AnyLogic for a system dynamics model, we explore how AI adoption correlates with jobs eliminated and created over the next decade.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and predictions (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
- **AnyLogic**: System dynamics simulation of AI adoption and job impact.

## How to Run the Simulation
1. Download the `.alp` file and open it in AnyLogic (version  8.9.1 or later).
2. Run the simulation to observe the AI adoption rate, jobs eliminated, and jobs created over time.
3. View the `TimePlot` or export the results for further analysis.

## Python Analysis
- The `AI_Trends_data_analysis` script analyzes AI adoption growth and revenue predictions for 2025 and 2026 using linear regression.

## Results
- Predicted AI adoption rates for 2025 and 2026: X%
- Predicted job impact: X million jobs eliminated, X million jobs created

## Next Steps
- Extend the analysis to include other factors such as AI regulations or different industry sectors.
